# HAProxy Load Balancer Setup

## ðŸ“– Introduction

HAProxy is used as a TCP load balancer to distribute Kubernetes API traffic across multiple control plane nodes. This improves **high availability** and **fault tolerance** of your Kubernetes cluster in an air-gapped environment.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation (Air-Gapped)

### 1. Download HAProxy RPM on a machine with internet access

```bash
yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=. haproxy

```
### 2.  Transfer RPM to HAProxy node 

Use scp or USB to copy the .rpm file to your HAProxy host.

### 3. Install RPM on the HAProxy node

```bash

rpm -ivh haproxy-*.rpm

```
